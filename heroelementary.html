						<p>In June 2020, my team shipped 15 games as part of the launch of the new PBS IP Hero Elementary. These games were a huge success, for which my team won several awards.</p>
						<p>In the first 6 months after launch, the 4 games featured on the PBSKids app and website were played over 20 million times. These games had twice the average playtime of any other game on the PBS Games App.</p> 
						<p>Each game is made for an audience of 5-8 year olds, and teaches a core STEM concept. I was Designer or Lead Designer on all of these games, as well as writing all the scripts, and playtesting at local schools.</p>

						<p>Décorum might be about solving a puzzle, but it's really a game about communication and compromise. The real challenge isn't just solving the problem with the limited information you and your players have; it's dealing with the frustrations that will inevitably occur when your partner does something that messes up your plan. In order to be successful in Décorum, there will come a point where both players will have to let go of their initial strategy for how they were going to finish the board, and start paying attention to what their partner is doing instead. By introducing and providing an incentive to resolve conflict, Décorum mechanically encourages (or even requires) a positive form of compromise.</p>
						<p>We call Décorum "a game of passive-aggressive cooperation" because the player's relationship to each other is unique. They're fundamentally cooperating--they have the same win state and everything. But, inevitably, there will come a time when it won't feel like they're on the same side. By the end of a (successful) game, however, the players will have worked through their disagreement and even strengthened their relationship. Décorum mechanically encourages a dramatic arc for its participants--one that ends with compromise, cooperation, and, hopefully, friendship! </p>
