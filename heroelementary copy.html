						<p>Skillsville was my second project with Twin Cities PBS, funded by a grant from the US Department of Education. Its goal was to help children ages 5-8 develop critical executive functioning skills that lay the groundwork for future success in school and the workplace.</p>
						<br>
						<p>As the lead game designer for Skillsville, I led the design and production of our digital games. I also developed our tabletop games, eBooks and virtual field trips entirely in-house.</p> 
						<br>
						<p>The entire Skillsville team was required to stop all work early due to an executive order defunding PBS. Much of our planned content was canceled and many people lost their jobs. What has been published has been extremely well received, and used by millions of kids across the United States.</p>

						<p>Décorum might be about solving a puzzle, but it's really a game about communication and compromise. The real challenge isn't just solving the problem with the limited information you and your players have; it's dealing with the frustrations that will inevitably occur when your partner does something that messes up your plan. In order to be successful in Décorum, there will come a point where both players will have to let go of their initial strategy for how they were going to finish the board, and start paying attention to what their partner is doing instead. By introducing and providing an incentive to resolve conflict, Décorum mechanically encourages (or even requires) a positive form of compromise.</p>
						<p>We call Décorum "a game of passive-aggressive cooperation" because the player's relationship to each other is unique. They're fundamentally cooperating--they have the same win state and everything. But, inevitably, there will come a time when it won't feel like they're on the same side. By the end of a (successful) game, however, the players will have worked through their disagreement and even strengthened their relationship. Décorum mechanically encourages a dramatic arc for its participants--one that ends with compromise, cooperation, and, hopefully, friendship! </p>
